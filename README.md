# AdventOfCode2020

These are the solutions for the programming puzzles that were part of the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com)

The first day of the Advent was solved using C#, but later I decided to use F#.
The C# project (AdventOfCode2020) with the first day puzzle is still there, but it was converted to a F# project (AdventOfCode2020F) where the solution for all days are.

Here are some friends repositories for the Advent of Code 2020 in other language:
